/**
 * Currently test's only purpose is
 * testing that the Query class has methods (and, or, join, etc.) that can interact with Specification,
 * CriteriaBuilder, and other JPA constructs. Testing ensures these interactions behave as expected.
 * Testing the compatibility for the current version of jakarta.persistence-api and spring-data-jpa
 * is necessary to be sure that this library is compatible with the Spring project which is using it.
